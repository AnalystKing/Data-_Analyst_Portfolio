Documented here are some of the projects I have worked on using Power BI as the primary tool. Power BI was used to perform some or all the following tasks on the data;

Importing and loading the raw data
Exploring and checking the data for missing values and formatting
Cleaning the data
Creating calculated columns
Creating visuals for reporting or dashboard
Creating dashboards for easy interaction with the data
Publishing and sharing the report

I do hope you find it insightful and interactive ðŸ™‚
